Data Visualization is one of the effective interfaces that allows users (information consumers) to easily communicate reliable or useful information. When visualization techniques are equipped well with intelligent algorithms and/or machine learning techniques, the integrated technology becomes a powerful tool that enables smart information filtering on the user side.  Here, I showcase selected samples of my data visualization and intelligent user interface development works.  Most of the works here were implemented using HTML5 + Javascript (d3.js, node.js), Java or <a title="http://processing.org" href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>.

As the importance of social media increases in our daily life, most adopters witness its significant impact on numerous practices in different areas such as business marketing, journalism, entertainment, and social sciences. However, the enormous amount of data makes the overall content difficult to assess and comprehend for both users and information analysts, raising scalability issues. Furthermore, timely understanding of trending topics is a crucial element due to the short life characteristic of most topics in microblogs. In this paper, we present a novel data visualization approach for real-time social data stream analytics using Twitter streaming data. The visual and architectural design of the system has been implemented as a real-time visualization framework, showing the most trendy tweets, hashtags and sentiment of individual messages. The framework proposed in this paper showcases visualization of real-time message streams through different presentation methods with animation effects highlighting the nature of live information streams. Several scenarios are provided as examples of possible application of this system, including deployment as an information canvas that provides an overview of currently trending topics as a wall-sized interactive media arts installation.

The visualization Samples or Screenshots displayed below are from the Seattle Public Library DataViz project (as a course project of MAT259). The visualizations in this section are programmed in Processing + Java. In the frequent keywords visualization, Natural Language ToolKit Library (NLTK) is also used in order to detect stopwords in the result.
