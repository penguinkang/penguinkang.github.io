An exploratory journey along social data streams

# Research

## Research Interests
I am interested in both foundation and application of Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI). Three major research fields are Artificial Intelligence and Human Computer Interaction(HCI) and Visual Data Analytics.  The motivation that walked me into the field of IUI was to develop intelligent interaction techniques for human.

* Machine Learning including Deep Learning
* Social Computing (Social Web Search & Mining / Information Reliability on the Web)
* User Interface Design and Human Factor Analysis
    - Visual Analytics: Interactive Data Analysis and Information Visualizations
    - Pattern Recognition (Vision, Image, Text and Graph)
    - Multimodal Interaction
* Cognitive Science – Human Perception and Recognition on the Web
* Media Art (Data Curation and Visualization)
